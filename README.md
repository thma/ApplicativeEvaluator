# ApplicativeEvaluator

I was rereading the Typeclassopedia and in the section of applicative functor I came accross the link to classic paper of McBride and Paterson: http://strictlypositive.org/Idiom.pdf.

As a practical programmer reading a paper is not enough, to really grog the stuff I'm reading I must get my hands dirty with some real code.
